The Scrapy library has been used to crawl and scrape. Beautiful soup could have also been used for the scraping purpose, but for the sake of consistency, Scrapy has been used for both purposes.Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.Even though Scrapy was originally designed forweb scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such asAmazon Associates Web Services) or as a general purpose web crawler.Four Spiders have been created for each category to be scraped. Every spider crawls all the states in Germany and scrapes all the apartment listings for important data. Every spider creates a separate JSON file to store all its data. This data is then converted to CSV using another python script called “conversion”.The python tool has been completely automated and only needs the “Controller” script to be run. The script also has the capability of running every two weeks automatically.Project DeliverablesFour CSV files (one for each category):Mieten Wohnungen.csvKaufen Wohnungen.csvKaufen Anlageobjekte.csvKaufen Grundstuck.csvLanguage/techniques usedPythonWeb Crawling & ScrapingSkills usedData ScrapingData CrawlingAdvanced Python programmingProject SnapshotsPrevious articleTraction Dashboards of Marketing Campaigns and PostsNext articleDatawarehouse, and Recommendations Engine for AirBNBAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORIntegrating Machine Learning Code into Kubeflow Pipeline – Kuberflow MLOps KubernetesFacial Recognition Attendance SystemFace Recognition Using DeepFaceMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSIOT, AI, ML for Machine TrackingJune 19, 2020How robots can help in e-learning platforms?July 19, 2021How AI will impact the future of work?May 26, 2021An ETL solution for an Internet Publishing firmJuly 26, 2023Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSBig Data solution to an online multivendor marketplace eCommerce businessThe rise of the OTT platform and its impact on the...Centrality Measures & Their Meaning from the Network GraphsCloud-Based Data Modeling and Analysis Platform with Drag-and-Drop Interface and OpenAI...
