The dataset contained Short durations as well as Long durations. Build models for each set of durations, compare and get the best out of all.Our SolutionHere, we had to predict the traffic incident duration with some machine learning tools and techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR and Deep Learning algorithm using tensor flow. First two models were run on Python Interpreter whereas Deep learning model was run on R studio, all the three with the same dataset and then we had compared these models based on their MAE (mean absolute error). Initially, we had done a preliminary analysis of the collected incident duration data, to collect the statistical characteristics of all the variables used in our research.Project DeliverablesPython Script for each model.Documentation for Research Work.Tools usedPython InterpreterLanguage/techniques usedLanguage Used: PythonLibraries Used: pandas, sklearn, numpy, keras, pickleModels usedXGBRegressorSVRSGDRegressorSequentialDecisionTreeRegressorSkills usedProgramming, Statistical AnalysisProject SnapshotsPrevious articleStatistical Data Analysis of Reinforced ConcreteNext articleHow does Metaverse work in the Financial sector?Ajay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORIntegrating Machine Learning Code into Kubeflow Pipeline – Kuberflow MLOps KubernetesFacial Recognition Attendance SystemFace Recognition Using DeepFaceMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSAI Conversational Bot using RASAFebruary 19, 2022Car Parking Management SystemJune 12, 2019How advertisement/marketing affects business.November 19, 2022How will COVID-19 affect the world of work?April 30, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSCloud-Based Web Application for Financial Data Processing and Visualization of S&P...AI and ML technologies to Evaluate Learning AssessmentsHow big data & analytics is helping fashion e-tailers to capture...COVID-19 Impact on Hospitality Industry
