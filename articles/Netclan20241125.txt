We have found the co-relation between the tempa msa pitchbook data and the output files like textual file, ai_ml_tm file etc. We have made the dashboard using the Google Data Studio.Project DeliverablesWe have provided a excel file consisting of clean data and the Google Data Studio report.Tools usedPython, Google Data Studio, Google ChromeLanguage/techniques usedPython ProgrammingModels usedWaterfall model used in this project.Skills usedData cleaning, Data Pre-processing, Data Visualisation are used in this project.Databases usedWe have used the traditional file systems as database storage.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionCleaning the data was the major challenge faced while executing the project. The data has a lot of noise. It was difficult to find which data was useful and which data is not useful in this project. Secondly the co relation between the output files and pitchbook data. There was nothing common between both the datasets. So was difficult to find co-relation between them.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedWe used pandas dataframe to clean the data and make it ready for predictive modelling and used the Google Data studio to find insights between the different datasets.Project SnapshotsProject VideoPrevious articleAWS QuickSight Reporting DashboardNext articleHow Metaverse is Shaping the Future?Ajay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORIntegrating Machine Learning Code into Kubeflow Pipeline – Kuberflow MLOps KubernetesFacial Recognition Attendance SystemFace Recognition Using DeepFaceMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSWhy does your business need a chatbot?September 22, 2020NLP-based Approach for Data TransformationJuly 29, 2023How big data & analytics is helping fashion e-tailers to capture...March 24, 2018Data science – Create Tailored algorithmsJune 14, 2019Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSAdvanced Patient Data Analysis Solution for Trend Identification and Improved Healthcare...Credit Scoring modelRise of Cybercrime and its Effect in upcoming FutureHow does marketing influence businesses and consumers?
