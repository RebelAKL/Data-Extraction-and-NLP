First was the ingestion of existing data into the cloud-based CRM platform.2. Second was the question of automating the process of adding newer records to the cloud platform.Project DeliverablesThe client has been provided with python scripting handling bulk data ingestion to CRM and also the script to handle daily synchronization of data.Tools used– Python– MySQL Database– Postman– TeamViewerLanguage/techniques used– Automation– 3rdparty APIs– Authentication methods– Multi-Threading of function calls– bat Scripts for easier running of scripts for the clientModels usedPython Frameworks like requests to build own custom client for consumption of APIs.Skills usedPython Programming, Mult-threading, APIsDatabases usedThe client provided a MySQL instance.Web Cloud Servers usedZohoWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution?– Writing own client-side API-consumption code handling API calls from Authentication and Other Operations as per task requirements.– Debugging of API responses was messy.How the Technical Challenges were Solved– Multiple alternatives were discussed and implemented in python like conditional refreshing of API tokens.– Automation of daily synchronization handled by use of time deltas.– Logging of all operations to efficiently handle errors in the future.Business Impact– Automated workflow of the client– No need for dull tasks like data entry to CRM modules everything is taken care of using logic.URLhttps://www.exportgenius.in/Previous articleA web-based dashboard for the filtered data retrieval of land recordsNext articleTransform API into SDK library and widgetAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORIntegrating Machine Learning Code into Kubeflow Pipeline – Kuberflow MLOps KubernetesFacial Recognition Attendance SystemFace Recognition Using DeepFaceMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSReal life data analysis on stationary and non-stationary Time SeriesFebruary 18, 2019What is the limitation of e-learning classes?December 7, 2021Artificial intelligence in business: Separating the real from the hypeSeptember 25, 2018Enhancing Data Collection for Research Institutions: Addressing Survey Fatigue and Incorporating...August 25, 2024Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSCoronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Effect: The Impact and Role of Mass Media...Design and develop MLops framework for Data-centric AIBig Data Integration & Infrastructure SolutionGrafana Dashboard – Oscar Awards
